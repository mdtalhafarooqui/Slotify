# Slotify 🚗

Slotify is a smart parking slot management system designed to efficiently allocate and manage parking spaces using data structures. The system automates vehicle entry and exit, identifies the next available slot, and displays real-time parking status, demonstrating practical problem-solving with queues.

## ✨ Highlights
- Smart allocation of parking slots
- Real-time parking status display
- Next available slot prediction
- Automated vehicle entry and exit
- Simple and user-friendly interface

## 🧠 Core Concept
This project uses queue-based data structures (Circular Queue) to optimize parking space utilization. It demonstrates how data structures can be applied to solve real-world parking management problems efficiently.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- C – Core parking logic
- PHP – Server-side processing
- HTML, CSS, Bootstrap – Frontend UI
- Apache (XAMPP) – Local server

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Install XAMPP and start Apache
2. Place the project folder inside htdocs
3. Open http://localhost/parking/parking.html in a browser
4. Use the interface to manage parking slots
